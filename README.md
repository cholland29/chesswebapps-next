# ChessWebApps-Next

This is the **modern continuation** of my original [ChessWebApps-Original](https://github.com/cholland29/ChessWebApps_Original) project.  
The old repository (circa 2015, originally developed in Subversion) is preserved for posterity, while this repo focuses on **modernizing the concept** with up-to-date technologies.

## Goals
- Rebuild the original chess teaching tools with **modern web frameworks**  
- Introduce **React + TypeScript** (using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)) for the frontend  
- Add **AI-assisted features** to support chess training and teaching  
- Improve usability, maintainability, and overall code quality

## Tech Stack
- **React** (with TypeScript)
- **Vite** (fast build tool and dev server)
- **ESLint + Prettier** (linting & formatting)
- **GitHub Actions** (CI for build and lint checks)

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cholland29/ChessWebApps-Next.git
cd ChessWebApps-Next/web
npm install
npm run dev
