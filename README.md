# ChessWebApps-Original

This repository is preserved in its **original state** as a snapshot of work I did many years ago.  

## Background
Around **2015**, I created a set of experimental chess web applications intended to help my chess students.  
At the time, I was teaching the **Horizon Elementary School Chess Club** in *Madison, Alabama*, where I coached for about **13 years**.  

The project was originally developed in a **Subversion repository** hosted on *ProjectLocker.com*.  
At some point, the Subversion metadata was lost, leaving only the raw source files and directory structure.  
This repository was pushed to GitHub as-is to keep a permanent record of that work.

## Purpose of This Repo
- **Historical only** â€“ the code is not maintained or updated.  
- **Read-only** â€“ Iâ€™ve archived this repository so it will remain unchanged.  
- **Posterity** â€“ it represents an early attempt at building chess teaching tools with web technologies,  
  created during my years running the Horizon Elementary Chess Club.  

## Next Steps
Iâ€™ve started a separate repository for continuing development and modernization of these ideas  
(e.g., React-based front ends, updated tooling, and AI-assisted features).

*This repository stands as a time capsule of my early chess web app experiments and my years teaching  
young players at Horizon Elementary School Chess Club in Madison, Alabama.*
